## Situation
The Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) section within Marine Corps Base Quantico required an overhaul of their O365 application structure.
In 2021, the Marine Corps instituted a shift from on premises solutions to cloud based solutions via O365.
This change caused a shift from using shared network drives and SharePoint 2016 to using SharePoint Online tied to additional O365 applications.
Initially, there was a quick shift to Microsoft Teams and replaced shared drives while SharePoint 2016 was not replaced.
Headquarters Marine Corps policy required any personally identifiable information (PII) to be housed on SharePoint online with specific protected libraries and lists. Each list/library containing PII was required to be reported to HQMC for compliance with data loss prevention (DLP) policies, records management, and data governance.
In April 2024, Quantico EOD conducted a forcible adoption of SharePoint online platforms to synchronize efforts across the unit. As the unit assumed more projects it became difficult to monitor the progress of each of these events on a dry erase board and a series of file folders.

## Overall Results
Initial SharePoint Online site creation
    The creation of the site included multiple lists/libraries to improve functionality within the section.
    This increased the capacity of the EOD team to assume 29 concurrent acquisitions and 14 disassembly projects.
    A budget for over $150,000 was authorized for fiscal year 25 in the upcoming appropriation cycle, while approving over $40,000 in Q4 of fiscal year 24.
    Within the disassembly projects, the site started a collaborative environment for other EOD teams around the Marine Corps from North Carolina, California, and Japan to view progress of events and provide expertise in an online experience.
Follow-On User Training
    The user training enabled the leadership of the EOD team to create individual pages for specific programs within their team structure.
    Implementation of OneNote was used as a way to pass information to new members of the EOD team to assume roles and responsibilities upon joining the unit.
